.SH "NAME"
.PP
\fIloadbalance\fP - randomizes the order of A, AAAA and MX records.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fIloadbalance\fP will act as a round-robin DNS load balancer by randomizing the order of A, AAAA,
and MX records in the answer.

.PP
See Wikipedia
\[la]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_DNS\[ra] about the pros and cons of this
setup. It will take care to sort any CNAMEs before any address records, because some stub resolver
implementations (like glibc) are particular about that.

.IP \(bu 4
\fB\fCround_robin\fR policy randomizes the order of  A, AAAA, and MX records applying a uniform probability distribution. This is the default load balancing policy.
.IP \(bu 4
\fB\fCweighted\fR policy assigns weight values to IPs to control the relative likelihood of particular IPs to be returned as the first
(top) A/AAAA record in the answer. Note that it does not shuffle all the records in the answer, it is only concerned about the first A/AAAA record
returned in the answer.

.RS
.IP \(en 4
\fBWEIGHTFILE\fP is the file containing the weight values assigned to IPs for various domain names. If the path is relative, the path from the \fBroot\fP plugin will be prepended to it. The format is explained below in the \fIWeightfile\fP section.
.IP \(en 4
\fBDURATION\fP interval to reload \fB\fCWEIGHTFILE\fR and update weight assignments if there are changes in the file. The default value is \fB\fC30s\fR. A value of \fB\fC0s\fR means to not scan for changes and reload.

.SH "WEIGHTFILE"
.PP
The generic weight file syntax:

.PP
.RS

.nf

domain\-name1
ip11 weight11
ip12 weight12
ip13 weight13

domain\-name2
ip21 weight21
ip22 weight22

.fi
.RE

.PP
where \fB\fCipXY\fR is an IP address for \fB\fCdomain-nameX\fR and \fB\fCweightXY\fR is the weight value associated with that IP. The weight values are in the range of [1,255].

.PP
The \fB\fCweighted\fR policy selects one of the address record in the result list and moves it to the top (first) position in the list. The random selection takes into account the weight values assigned to the addresses in the weight file. If an address in the result list is associated with no weight value in the weight file then the default weight value "1" is assumed for it when the selection is performed.

Use the \fB\fCweighted\fR strategy to load balance replies supplied by the \fBfile\fP plugin. We assign weight vales \fB\fC3\fR, \fB\fC1\fR and \fB\fC2\fR to the IPs \fB\fC100.64.1.1\fR, \fB\fC100.64.1.2\fR and \fB\fC100.64.1.3\fR, respectively. These IPs are addresses in A records for the domain name \fB\fCwww.example.com\fR defined in the \fB\fC./db.example.com\fR zone file. The ratio between the number of answers in which \fB\fC100.64.1.1\fR, \fB\fC100.64.1.2\fR or \fB\fC100.64.1.3\fR is in the top (first) A record should converge to  \fB\fC3 : 1 : 2\fR.  (E.g. there should be twice as many answers with \fB\fC100.64.1.3\fR in the top A record than with \fB\fC100.64.1.2\fR).
